    <p style="text-align: center; color: blue;">A fish is an aquatic, anamniotic, gill-bearing vertebrate animal with
         swimming fins and a hard skull, but lacking limbs with digits. Fish can be grouped into the more basal jawless fish
          and the more common jawed fish, the latter including all living cartilaginous and bony fish, as well as the extinct
           placoderms and acanthodians. In a break from the long tradition of grouping all fish into
         a single class (Pisces), modern phylogenetics views fish as a paraphyletic group.</p>

         <p>Otodus megalodon (/ˈmɛɡələdɒn/ MEG-əl-ə-don; meaning "big tooth"), commonly known as megalodon, is an extinct
             species of giant mackerel shark that lived approximately 23 to 3.6 million years ago (Mya), from the Early Miocene 
             to the Early Pliocene epochs. This prehistoric fish was formerly thought to be a member of the family Lamnidae 
             and a close relative of the great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias), but has been reclassified into 
            the extinct family Otodontidae, which diverged from the great white shark during the Early Cretaceous.</p>
